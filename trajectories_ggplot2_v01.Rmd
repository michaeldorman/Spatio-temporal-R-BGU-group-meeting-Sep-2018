## Motivation

![https://oscarperpinan.github.io/rastervis/](https://oscarperpinan.github.io/rastervis/figs/vectorplot.png)

* Aim: recreate a "vectorplot" in `ggplot2`, but using a real dataset rather than a synthetic example 
* Specifically - 
    * We have a dataset with storm trajectories
    * We want to display a regular grid with of arrow segments, with direction and length representing the direction and intensity of storms passing through that grid cell
* How do we do that? 
    * Convert the trajectories to individual segments
    * Calculate the azimuth of each storm segment
    * Make a regular grid
    * Summarize the average azimuth and total length of storm segments
    * Calculate gridded segments, according average azimuth and total length in each cell
    * Plot

## Storms dataset

```{r}
library(dplyr)

storms = as.data.frame(storms)
head(storms)
```

## Storm ID

* There are storms with the same name in different years 
* To identify individual storm tracks we add a `name_year` ID variable -

```{r}
storms$name_year = paste(storms$name, storms$year)
head(storms)
```

## To points

* The table is converted to a point layer with `st_as_sf` using the `long` and `lat` columns -

```{r}
library(sf)

pnt = st_as_sf(storms, coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = 4326)
pnt
```

## Plot

```{r}
plot(pnt, max.plot = 12)
```

## Points to lines

* Next we want to create a layer of line segments between all consecutive points of each storm
* First we split the point layer by storm ID, to get a `list` of `POINT` subsets - 

```{r}
lines = split(pnt, pnt$name_year)
lines[1]
```

* Then, we combine the points to `MULTIPOINT` with `st_combine` - 

```{r}
lines = lapply(lines, st_combine)
lines[1]
```

* Casting to `LINESTRING` - 

```{r}
lines = lapply(lines, st_cast, "LINESTRING")
lines[1]
```

* The `list` of `LINESTRING` can be combined back to a geometry column with `c` - 

```{r}
geometry = do.call(c, lines)
geometry
```

* The corresponding attribute `name_year` is kept in the `list` element names - 

```{r}
attr = data.frame(name_year = names(lines), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(attr)
```

* Combining the geometry and attributes back to an `sf` layer - 

```{r}
lines = st_sf(geometry, attr)
lines
```

## Lines

```{r}
plot(lines)
```

## Lines to segments

* To calculate segment azimuth, we split the lines to segments - 

```{r}
library(shadow)

seg = 
  lines %>% 
  as("Spatial") %>% 
  toSeg %>% 
  st_as_sf
seg
```

* Casting to `MULTIPOINT`; each segment is converted to a pair of points - 

```{r}
seg_pnt = st_cast(seg, "MULTIPOINT")
seg_pnt
```

## Segment azimuth

* Azimuth can be calculated with `bearingRhumb` from package `geosphere`
* For example, here are the coordinates of the first storm segment - 

```{r}
x = st_coordinates(seg_pnt[1, ])
x
```

* And here is its azimuth - 

```{r}
library(geosphere)

bearingRhumb(x[1, 1:2], x[2, 1:2])
```

* Now, the same can be done for all segments
* We create a list of segment coordinates - 

```{r}
coords = lapply(st_geometry(seg_pnt), st_coordinates)
head(coords)
```

* Then apply `bearingRhumb` on the list - 

```{r}
seg$az = sapply(coords, function(x) bearingRhumb(x[1, 1:2], x[2, 1:2]))
seg = seg[!is.na(seg$az), ] # Remove zero distance segments
seg
```

* We also need the segment centroids for later - 

```{r}
seg_ctr = st_centroid(seg)
seg_ctr
```

```{r}
plot(seg_ctr)
```

## Make grid

* Making a regular grid with a unique ID - 

```{r}
grid = st_make_grid(lines, cellsize = 2)
grid = st_sf(grid, data.frame(id = 1:length(grid)))
grid
```

```{r}
plot(grid)
```

## Trajectory length per grid cell

* Next we need to find the total trajectory length per grid cell
* First we intersect the `grid` and `seg` layers, and calculate the length per segment -

```{r}
grid_seg = st_intersection(grid, seg)
grid_seg$length = st_length(grid_seg)
grid_seg
```

* Then we aggregate the table, summarizing total length -

```{r}
grid_seg_agg = aggregate(
  x = st_set_geometry(grid_seg[, "length"], NULL), 
  by = data.frame(id = grid_seg$id), 
  FUN = sum
)
head(grid_seg_agg)
```

* And join back to the grid - 

```{r}
grid = left_join(grid, grid_seg_agg, "id")
grid
```

```{r}
plot(grid)
```

## Average segment azimuth

* Azimuth should be averaged using circular statistics, for example -

```{r}
library(circular)

angles = c(2, 359)

# Simple mean
mean(angles)

# Circular mean
anglecir = circular(angles, type="angles", units="degrees", modulo="2pi", template="geographics")
as.numeric(mean(anglecir))
```

* And now for our data, averaging individual segment azimuths per grid cell -

```{r}
f = function(x) {
  anglecir = circular(x, type="angles", units="degrees", modulo="2pi", template="geographics")
  m = mean(anglecir)
  as.numeric(m)
}
grid_b = aggregate(x = seg_ctr[, "az"], by = grid, FUN = f)
grid_b
```

```{r}
plot(grid_b)
```

## Grid centroids

* For the final visualization we need the grid cell centroids - 

```{r}
grid_ctr = st_centroid(grid)
```

```{r}
plot(grid_ctr)
```

* The average azimuths can be joined to the grid centroids using spatial join with `st_join` - 

```{r}
grid_ctr = st_join(grid_ctr, grid_b)
grid_ctr = grid_ctr[!is.na(grid_ctr$az) & !is.na(grid_ctr$length), ]
grid_ctr
```

```{r}
plot(grid_ctr)
```

## Shift grid centroids

* Grid cell centroids will comprise the segment staring point
* To get the ending point, we shift the starting point - 
    * In the direction of average storm segment azimuth
    * With distance proportional to total segment length

```{r}
library(scales)

grid_ctr_shifted = 
  grid_ctr %>% 
  as("Spatial") %>% 
  shiftAz(
    az = grid_ctr$az, 
    dist = rescale(as.numeric(grid_ctr$length), c(0, 3))
  ) %>% 
  st_as_sf
```

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(grid_ctr[1:3, ]))
plot(st_geometry(grid_ctr_shifted[1:3, ]), col = "red", add = TRUE)
```

## Final table

* The final table - 

```{r}
dat = cbind(
  data.frame(
    lon0 = st_coordinates(grid_ctr)[, 1],
    lat0 = st_coordinates(grid_ctr)[, 2],
    length = grid_ctr$length,
    az = grid_ctr$az
  ),
  data.frame(
    lon1 = st_coordinates(grid_ctr_shifted)[, 1],
    lat1 = st_coordinates(grid_ctr_shifted)[, 2]
  )
)
dat = dat[, c("lon0", "lat0", "lon1", "lat1", "length", "az")]
head(dat)
```

## Initial plot

```{r, fig.width=11}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(dat) +
  geom_sf(data = lines, colour = "lightgrey") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = lon0, y = lat0, xend = lon1, yend = lat1)) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Circular colors

* Setting colors - 

```{r}
cols = circular.colors(n = 12)
cols
```

* Setting color breaks - 

```{r}
dat$b1 = cut(dat$az, breaks = seq(0, 360, 30))
head(dat)
```

## Final plot

```{r, fig.width=11}
ggplot(dat) +
  geom_sf(data = lines, colour = "lightgrey", alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = lon0, y = lat0, xend = lon1, yend = lat1, size = length, colour = b1), 
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.015, "npc"))
  ) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0.15, 1), guide = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual("Azimuth (Â°)", values = cols) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank()
  )
```

## Summary

* Often, much of the time in visualization is spent on reshaping the dataset to the right form

## Other ideas

* Equal-area grid
* Weight by wind speed too, not just length
* Segment centred on grid cell
